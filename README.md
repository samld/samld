# Hi, I’m @samld

I am a software developper based in Trois-Rivières, Quebec. I work as a consultant to provide management solutions to entrepeneurs, organizations and individuals. I'm interested in software engineering, foreign languages, music, horror media and visual arts. My main focus as a software developer is to keep things extensible, simple and concise in that particular order. My main area of expertise is mainly backend development in C#, although I'm fairly comfortable with Typescript, and React or SvelteJS. I tend to approach software from a lean perspective, and try to eliminate waste where possible.

I speak French at home, but I'm fluent in English. Currently trying to learn German and Ancient Greek. I am a cofounder of Kernos (https://kernos.tech).
