# Hi, Iâ€™m @samld

I am a software developper based in the Greater Montreal area. I work as a consultant to provide management solutions for entrepeneurs, organization and individuals. I'm interested in software engineering, computer science and mathematics. I enjoy working on open source software and I've been programming since I was a child.
